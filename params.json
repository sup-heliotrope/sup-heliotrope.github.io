{"name":"Sup-heliotrope.github.io","tagline":"","body":"### [sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/)\r\n[Sup](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/) is a console-based email client for people with a lot of email. It supports tagging, very fast full-text search, automatic contact-list management, custom code insertion via a hook system, and more. If you're the type of person who treats email as an extension of your long-term memory, Sup is for you.\r\n\r\nSup makes it easy to:\r\n\r\n * Handle massive amounts of email.\r\n * Mix email from different sources: mbox files and maildirs.\r\n * For remote sources (IMAP, IMAPS, ssh+file), use another tool (offlineimap, fetchmail, rsync) to grab local copies.\r\n * Instantaneously search over your entire email collection. Search over body text, or use a query language to combine search predicates in any way.\r\n * Handle multiple accounts. Replying to email sent to a particular account will use the correct SMTP server, signature, and from address.\r\n * Add custom code to handle certain types of messages or to handle certain types of text within messages.\r\n * Organize email with user-defined labels, automatically track recent contacts, and much more!\r\n * The goal of Sup is to become the email client of choice for nerds everywhere.\r\n\r\n### [Heliotrope](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/heliotrope)\r\n[Heliotrope](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/heliotrope) is an architectural shift from sup that maintains many of the same concepts, but separates out a server and client.\r\nContrast to what is done in sup, where one large client installation has all the mail documents and indexes locally, Heliotrope provides a server-side service that indexes mail.\r\n\r\nIn this way, remote clients can connect up and interact with their mail stores in a sup-like way, while keeping the mobile install slim.\r\nThis is a lifesaver when switching from machine to machine.\r\n\r\n### [Turnisole](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/turnsole)\r\n[Turnisole](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/turnsole) is an example client that would connect to Heliotrope and interact with mail.\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\n * [There is a new Github wiki available.](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/wiki)\r\n * [And Github Issues are enabled.](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/issues)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nSup is brought to you by [a cast of hackers.](https://github.com/sup-heliotrope/sup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS)\r\n\r\nOriginally, sup was a project maintained by William Morgan at [http://sup.rubyforge.org/](http://sup.rubyforge.org/).\r\n\r\n[git was in Gitorious](http://gitorious.org/sup)\r\n\r\nThere was also a nice wiki on Rubyforge, but it has since fallen prey to mischievous robots.\r\n\r\n<img srg=\"http://supmua.org/images/wiki_bot_death.png\"/>","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
